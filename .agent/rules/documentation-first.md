# Documentation-First Development

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This rule delegates to the **Documentation Skill**.
> Please refer to `Use the view_file tool to read .agent/skills/documentation/SKILL.md` for detailed instructions.

You must follow the "Documentation-First" approach:

1.  **Read** docs/plans before coding.
2.  **Update** docs/plans during coding.
3.  **Create** new docs after adding features.

See the **Documentation Skill** for templates and specific workflows.
